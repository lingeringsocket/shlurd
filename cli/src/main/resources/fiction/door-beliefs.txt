A door must be open or closed.
If a game-character traverses a door, then the door must be open;
 otherwise the game-interpreter complains "But the door is not open.".

A map-place may have a northern-door.
A map-place may have a southern-door.
A map-place may have an eastern-door.
A map-place may have a western-door.

If a game-character goes north, then
 the game-character traverses the game-character's container's northern-door.
If a game-character goes south, then
 the game-character traverses the game-character's container's southern-door.
If a game-character goes east, then
 the game-character traverses the game-character's container's eastern-door.
If a game-character goes west, then
 the game-character traverses the game-character's container's western-door.
