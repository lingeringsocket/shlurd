There is a game-turn.

Whenever the game-turn advances,
 the player-character has no visible-items;
 also the player-character surveys the player-character's container;
 also the player-character perceives the player-character and the
 player-character's stuff;
 also the player-character becomes the player-character's container's place-discoverer.

When the game-turn debuts,
 the game-turn advances;
 also the player-character looks.
