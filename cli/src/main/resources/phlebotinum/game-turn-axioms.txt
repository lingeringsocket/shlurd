There is a game-turn.

Whenever the game-turn advances,
 the player-character has no visible-items;
 also the player-character surveys the player-character's container;
 also the player-character perceives the player-character and the
 player-character's stuff;
 also the player-character becomes the player-character's container's place-discoverer;
 also all non-player-characters begin the game-turn.

When the game-turn initializes,
 the player-character initializes.

When the game-turn reloads,
 the game-turn advances;
 also the player-character looks.
