A stuff is a kind of an object.
A game-character must have a stuff.
The player-character's stuff exists.

Before a game-character gets a game-object,
 it must not be in the game-character's stuff;
 otherwise the game-interpreter complains "But you already have that.".
Before a game-character gets a game-object,
 it must be in the game-character's container;
 otherwise the game-interpreter complains "But there is no such object here.".
After a game-character gets a game-object,
 it is in the game-character's stuff.
Before a game-character drops a game-object,
 it must be in the game-character's stuff;
 otherwise the game-interpreter complains "But you have no such object.".
After a game-character drops a game-object,
 it falls onto the game-character's container.

After a game-object falls onto a map-place,
 the game-object is in the map-place;
 also the player-character perceives the game-object.

// FIXME:  should be able to use "it is in the game-character's stuff" instead
If a game-character is holding a game-object, then equivalently
 its container is the game-character's stuff.

Whenever the game-turn advances,
 the player-character perceives {the player-character's stuff}'s contained-objects.
