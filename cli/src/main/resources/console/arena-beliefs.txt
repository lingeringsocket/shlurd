An arena-cell is a kind of location.

An arena-cell's northern-neighbor must be an arena-cell.
An arena-cell's southern-neighbor must be an arena-cell.
An arena-cell's western-neighbor must be an arena-cell.
An arena-cell's eastern-neighbor must be an arena-cell.

When  an arena-cell is above another arena-cell,
 consequently the former is the latter's northern-neighbor;
 also the latter is the former's southern-neighbor.

When an arena-cell is before another arena-cell,
 consequently the former is the latter's western-neighbor;
 also the latter is the former's eastern-neighbor.

An animal's target-cell must be an arena-cell.
An animal may have a target-cell.

An arena-direction is a kind of object.
A north, a south, an east, or a west is a kind of arena-direction.
An arena-direction's opposite-direction must be an arena-direction.
An arena-direction must have an opposite-direction.

There is a north and a south.
The north is the south's opposite-direction.

There is an east and a west.
The east is the west's opposite-direction.

When an animal goes an arena-direction,
 the animal moves to the arena-direction.

When an animal goes to an arena-direction,
 the animal moves to the arena-direction.

When an animal moves to an arena-direction,
 the animal targets the arena-direction;
 also the animal relocates.

When an animal targets the north,
 subsequently the animal's target-cell is
  the animal's spc-container's northern-neighbor.

When an animal targets the south,
 subsequently the animal's target-cell is
  the animal's spc-container's southern-neighbor.

When an animal targets the west,
 subsequently the animal's target-cell is
  the animal's spc-container's western-neighbor.

When an animal targets the east,
 subsequently the animal's target-cell is
  the animal's spc-container's eastern-neighbor.

After an animal relocates,
 the animal is in the animal's target-cell.
