A place-discoverer must be a player-character.
A map-place may have place-discoverers.

Before a game-character heads to a map-direction,
 the game-character's container's place-exit must be in the map-direction;
 otherwise the game-interpreter complains
  "There is no way to go in that direction.".

When a game-character heads to a map-direction,
 the game-character traverses
  (the game-character's container's place-exit in the map-direction).

When a game-character goes a map-direction,
 the game-character heads to the map-direction.

When a game-character goes upward,
 the game-character heads to the zenith.

When a game-character goes downward,
 the game-character heads to the nadir.

Before a game-character traverses a map-connection,
 the map-connection's exit-door must be open;
 otherwise the game-interpreter complains "But the door is not open.".

When a game-character traverses a map-connection,
 the game-character relocates to the map-connection's target-place.

Before a player-character moves to a map-place,
 the map-place must be the player-character's container's map-neighbor;
 otherwise the game-interpreter complains "You can't get there from here.".

When a game-character moves to a map-place,
 the game-character traverses (the map-place's place-entrances
  among the player-character's container's place-exits).

After a game-character relocates to a map-place,
 the game-character is in the map-place.

When a game-character enters a map-location,
 the game-character moves to the map-location.

After a game-character relocates to a map-place,
 the game-character surveys the map-place.

When a game-character surveys a map-place,
 the game-character perceives the map-place and
  the map-place's spc-contained-objects;
 also the game-character surveys the map-place's place-exits;
 also the game-character surveys the map-place's place-entrances.

When a game-character surveys a map-connection,
 the game-character perceives the map-connection and
  the map-connection's exit-doors.

When a player-character relocates to a map-place,
 the player-character might be the map-place's place-discoverer;
 otherwise the player-character discovers the map-place.
When a player-character relocates to a map-place,
 the player-character might not be the map-place's place-discoverer;
 otherwise the player-character rediscovers the map-place.
