A map-connection is a kind of describable-entity.
A straight-connection is a kind of map-connection.

A map-neighbor must be a map-place.
A map-place may have map-neighbors.
A map-place with a map-neighbor is a map-neighbor.

A source-place must be a map-place.

An opposite-connection must be a map-connection.
A map-connection may have an opposite-connection.
A map-connection with an opposite-connection is an opposite-connection.

A source-place must be a map-place.
A target-place must be a map-place.
A map-place with a place-exit is a source-place.
A map-place with a place-entrance is a target-place.

If a map-connection opposes a map-place to a map-direction, then
 the map-place's place-exit in the map-direction is
  the map-connection's opposite-connection.

If a map-place faces a destination-place to a map-direction, then
 the map-place has a place-exit in the map-direction;
 also the destination-place has a place-exit in the map-direction's opposite-direction;
 also the map-place's place-exit in the map-direction is a straight-connection;
 also the destination-place's place-exit in the map-direction's opposite-direction is
  a straight-connection;
 also the map-place's place-exit in the map-direction opposes
  the destination-place to the map-direction's opposite-direction;
 also the map-place is the destination-place's map-neighbor.

If a map-place faces a destination-place to a map-direction, then equivalently
 (the map-place's place-exit in the map-direction)'s
  target-place is the destination-place.
If a map-place faces a destination-place to a map-direction, then equivalently
 (the destination-place's place-exit in the map-direction's opposite-direction)'s
  target-place is the map-place.

If a map-place is north of a neighbor-place, then equivalently
 the neighbor-place faces the map-place to the north.
If a map-place is south of a neighbor-place, then equivalently
 the neighbor-place faces the map-place to the south.
If a map-place is east of a neighbor-place, then equivalently
 the neighbor-place faces the map-place to the east.
If a map-place is west of an neighbor-place, then equivalently
 the neighbor-place faces the map-place to the west.

If a map-place is northeast of a neighbor-place, then equivalently
 the neighbor-place faces the map-place to the northeast.
If a map-place is northwest of a neighbor-place, then equivalently
 the neighbor-place faces the map-place to the northwest.
If a map-place is southeast of a neighbor-place, then equivalently
 the neighbor-place faces the map-place to the southeast.
If a map-place is southwest of a neighbor-place, then equivalently
 the neighbor-place faces the map-place to the southwest.

If a map-place is above a neighbor-place, then equivalently
 the neighbor-place faces the map-place to the zenith.
If a map-place is below a neighbor-place, then equivalently
 the neighbor-place faces the map-place to the nadir.

A door is a kind of describable-entity.
An exit-door must be a door.
A door-exit must be a map-connection.
A map-connection may have an exit-door.
A door may have door-exits.
A map-connection with an exit-door is a door-exit.
A door must be open or closed.

If a door mediates a map-connection, then
 the door is the map-connection's exit-door.
