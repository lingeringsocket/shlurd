An oracle is a kind of non-player-character.

After a player-character beseeches an oracle,
 the game-interpreter says "Answer me these questions three.".

// Wordnet has adjure and beseech as synonyms.  We want to verify that
// from the user level, they are synonymous; whereas for triggering purposes,
// they are distinct.
When a player-character ululates,
 the player-character adjures the oracle;
 also the game-interpreter says "Blood is trickling from my ears.".
