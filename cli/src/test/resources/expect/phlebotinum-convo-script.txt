Welcome to a tepid smorgasbord of nostalgia.

You are in a bedroom.

Grubby articles of alien underwear lie scattered about.

You see a big door to the east.

OK.

You are in a bathroom.

Someone has written 'clean me!' on the mirror.

You see an axe and a thief.

You see the big door to the west.

// FIXME this should really be "talk to myself"
> talk to me

OK.

Only crazy people talk to themselves.

> say "hi" to me

OK.

Only crazy people talk to themselves.

OK.

Ze responds, "I am the thief."

> ask zir "where am I"

OK.

Ze responds, "You are in the bathroom."

> say "where is the lantern" to zir

OK.

Ze responds, "I don't know."

> tell zir "I am holding the lantern"

OK.

Ze responds, "Oh, really?"

> say "get the ax" to the thief

OK.

Ze responds, "No."

> talk to zir

OK.

(You are now in conversation.  Say TTYL to stop.)

"I am the thief."

> is the axe here

"Yes, the axe is here."

"Yes, the axe is there."

"I don't know."

"I see you, the battleaxe, and the big door to the west."

OK.

You are in the bedroom.

You see the big door to the east.

OK.

You are in a cupboard.

I hope you don't have claustrophobia.

You see an oracle.

> ask the oracle "where is the lantern"

OK.

The oracle responds, "It is in a kitchen."

> ask the oracle "who is holding the axe"

OK.

The oracle responds, "You are holding it."

> talk to the thief

You can only interact with what's nearby.

> beseech the oracle

OK.

Answer me these questions three.

It's a witch!

> adjure the oracle

OK.

Answer me these questions three.

It's a witch!

> ululate

OK.

It's a witch!

Blood is trickling from my ears.
