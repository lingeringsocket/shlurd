# shlurd

SHLURD is an attempt to support very limited natural language understanding for small worlds a la [SHRDLU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHRDLU).  It's implemented in Scala using [Stanford CoreNLP](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP) as the basis for its parser.

The first supported small world domain is [OpenHAB home automation](openhab/README.md).
