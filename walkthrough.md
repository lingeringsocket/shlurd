You are in a meadow.

You see a tree, a rock, and a cloud.

You see a grassy path to the south.

OK.

You are in a barn.

You see a child.

You see the grassy path to the north.

> show photo to child

OK.

"Aw, you must love 'er."

> ask the child "where is my wife"

OK.

They respond, "I don't know."

OK.

You are in the meadow.

You see the tree, the rock, and the cloud.

You see the grassy path to the south.

> love the cloud

OK.

You try, but it's so far away; maybe you should attempt something closer?

> love the tree

OK.

The leaves blush gold in the sunlight.

> love the rock

OK.

The rock seems to soften for a moment.

> love the cloud

OK.

The cloud gives a silvery shimmer.

By its light, you notice a faint trail leading east.
