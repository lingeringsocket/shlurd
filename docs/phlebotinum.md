# Phlebotinum

Phlebotinum is an interactive fiction system based on [SHLURD](readme.md).

It is similar to [Inform 7](inform7.com) in that a limited form of
natural language is used for authoring stories.  It is different in
that the same natural language is used while interpreting stories as
well.
